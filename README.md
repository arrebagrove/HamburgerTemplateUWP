# UWP Hamburger Menu

This is an hamburger menu template for UWP applications. Feel free to use it in your applications in any way. Free to use in both non-commercial and commercial applications. No credits needed, but when giving credits please give it to: *StefanJanssen*

I made this template using an online tutorial. Since I needed it in multiple projects I wanted to have a template for Visual Studio 2015.

Unfortunatly I forgot who built the original of the hamburger menu. Normally I give credits to everyone who did something in my work. Are you or do you know who made this, please make a pull request or contact me so I can give credits.
